## Alice Birkett

I am an aspiring Software Developer who is in the process of changing careers away from nursing. In the time that I have been learning software development I have been able to complete two independent projects that make use of a full MERN stack in addition to the work that I have done during my time on the Makers bootcamp. I have always been heavily interested in tech, and am excited by the idea of being able to work in an industry that is constantly adapting and innovating around new technologies.

## Skills

#### Communication
Communication has been a heavy focus throughout my professional life. As an ICU nurse this manifested when considering both communication with other colleagues, but also with the patients themselves. By utilising effective communication skills I was able to consider not just the input of the multidisciplinary team, but also of the patients and their families to provide them with a high standard of personalised healthcare. Communication was also an essential part of escalating concerns so that they could be addressed as quickly as possible to maintain patient safety. Examples of this include querying with a more senior nurse when unsure about how or why something should be done, or raising the alarm and communicating clearly during an emergency situation. This has made me feel confident in raising issues and queries with coaches when coding, and has allowed me to capitalise on my curiosity and desire to learn more.

#### Team working
Team working was an essential skill in ICU, as although I was usually 1 to 1 with my patient, there were always tasks throughout the day that would require the input and assistance of other nurses. This team working also extended to other members of the multidisciplinary team, allowing us to provide for a patient's holistic care needs as opposed to strictly medical. Some examples of this include pairing up with other nurses in order to reposition our patients safely, or by liaising with Physiotherapists to ensure that the patient would be available for their full physio session. This emphasis on team working extended into the Makers boot camp, as we were regularly engaging in group projects and pair programming throughout our curriculum.

#### Troubleshooting
Troubleshooting in ICU nursing was a regular skill that we employed on a daily basis. Firstly we would be responsible for ensuring that all of the equipment around our bed space was working correctly, and if it wasn't we would have to troubleshoot the equipment to establish why. An example of this is that during an emergency situation we found that our in-line suction wasn't working, but through me troubleshooting the situation and addressing the issue with our equipment we were still able to save the patient. This emphasis on troubleshooting also extended into anatomy and physiology, as I was frequently required to assess a patient and consider the potential underlying causes for their current presentation. An example of this comes in the form of a patient's blood pressure, as there are many different factors that can influence a low blood pressure with each one requiring a different treatment to address. This skill has been incredibly useful in software development so far as it has prepared me for troubleshooting and debugging code with a methodical and logical approach.

#### Working under pressure
The ICU was a very volatile workplace that could change completely over the course of the day. This has led me to develop my adaptive time keeping skills, as I frequently had to remain flexible to the changes in the unit. I was also frequently exposed to high pressure medical emergencies such as cardiac arrests, and have developed the ability to think clearly and remain calm during these in order to focus on the task at hand.
